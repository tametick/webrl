## Getting Write Access ##

Write access to the source base is given very liberally - simply ask one of the project owners & you will probably get it.


## Getting the source ##

Look at the [Source](http://code.google.com/p/webrl/source/checkout) tab on instructions regarding checkout from the Subversion repository.

## Developing ##

You can use your favorite editor or IDE to develop WebRL - it is only JavaScript, HTML & CSS.  However, a lot of us use Aptana.

### Step by step guide to developing WebRL in Aptana ###

  1. Download [Aptana Studio](http://www.aptana.org/studio/download) - don't forget to choose the jQuery JavaScript/AJAX plugin when prompted for extra plugins to install, and make sure the Subclipse plugin is also installed.
  1. Start Aptana and choose File->Import.
  1. SVN->checkout project from SVN.
  1. URL is https://webrl.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ (or with http if you don't have write access - just ask and you will be give one).
  1. Username and password can be seen here (need to be logged into Google Code): http://code.google.com/p/webrl/source/checkout.
  1. Choose the WebRL folder.
  1. Start coding! [index.html](http://code.google.com/p/webrl/source/browse/trunk/WebRL/index.html) is the natural place to look at first.
